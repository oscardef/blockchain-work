Why rpow? What does it do? Whats the point?


It will update the `debtAccumulatedRate` of the specified collateral pool according to 
the global and per-pool stability fee rates with respect to the last block that `collect` was called

What rpow does to the debtAccumulatedRate:
debtAccumulatedRate is set to previousRate*unit (RAY) if totalSFR is 0 and time passed is 0
debtAccumulatedRate is set to 0 if totalSFR is 0 and time passed is nonzero


When totalSFR is nonZero z will enter a for loop wherein the totalSFR is compounded to the starting z value (depending on if the time difference was even or odd?) for n/2 iterations.
This is done as a means to compound the debtAccumulatedRate over the given time difference rather than waste gas costs on applying the totalSFR each block. The debtAccumulated rate
Is finally calculated by multiplying the resulting z value from the rpow function with the _previousDebtAccumulatedRate.
